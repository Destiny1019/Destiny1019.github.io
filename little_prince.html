                <p>
                    "The Little Prince" is a novella written by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. 
                    It tells the story of a young prince who travels from planet to planet, 
                    learning lessons about life, love, and human nature. 
                    Despite being considered a children's book, it offers deep philosophical 
                    insights and has become one of the most translated and best-selling books in the world.
